Apache Calcite Avatica Go 3.0.0 is the first release of the Avatica [Go](https://golang.org/)
[database/sql](https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/) driver since the code has been donated to the Apache Calcite
project. This release includes support for Avatica with the HSQLDB backend, updated dependencies and [bug fixes]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/go_history.html#v3-0-0).

There is a breaking change where the `Name()` method on the `ResponseError` error type has been changed to a property, `Name`.

Users of the current `Boostport/avatica` library are encouraged to update to this new version of `apache/calcite-avatica-go`
as further development will take place in the `apache/calcite-avatica-go` repository.

For most users, the updating is simply replacing the import path `_ github.com/Boostport/avatica` with `_ github.com/fgwe/calcite-avatica-go`.

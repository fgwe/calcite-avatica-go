## <a href="https://github.com/fgwe/calcite-avatica-go/releases/tag/v5.0.0">5.0.0</a> / 2020-07-16
{: #v5-0-0}

Apache Calcite Avatica Go 5.0.0 is a major release of Avatica Go with a number of improvements and a breaking change.
As Go modules has been available since Go 1.11 (3 versions back as of writing), users of this library should
install it using Go modules as support for dep has been removed.

This release also introduces the `batching` query string parameter in the DSN, which allows updates to the server using
a prepared statement to be batched together and executed once `Close()` is called on the statement.

**Breaking change for connection metadata ([CALCITE-3248](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-3248)):** 
Previously, it is possible to set the HTTP username and password using the `username` and `password` parameters in the
query string of the DSN. These parameters were confusing and didn't signal the intent and effect of the parameters in addition
to clashing with the `avaticaUser` and `avaticaPassword` parameters. The `username` and `password` parameters have now been
removed as CALCITE-3248 implements the [Connector interface](https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/driver/#Connector) via the
`NewConnector()` method, which allows the driver to be instantiated with a custom HTTP client. Subsequently, it is now
possible to set up the driver with a custom HTTP client and decorate it with the `WithDigestAuth()`, `WithBasicAuth()`,
`WithKerberosAuth()` and `WithAdditionalHeaders()` methods.

## <a href="https://github.com/fgwe/calcite-avatica-go/releases/tag/v4.0.0">4.0.0</a> / 2019-05-16
{: #v4-0-0}

Apache Calcite Avatica Go 4.0.0 is a major release of Avatica Go with a number of improvements and a breaking change.
This release supports using both [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) and Go modules for package management. As Go modules
will be turned on by default in Go 1.13.0 (estimated to be released in September/October 2019), it is highly recommended
that users of this package start migrating to using Go modules to ease the transition.

**Breaking change for Phoenix ([CALCITE-2763](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-2724)):** 
In Apache Phoenix, null and empty strings are equivalent. For some background on why this is the case, see
[PHOENIX-947](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PHOENIX-947). In version 3 of Avatica-Go and below, null and empty
strings are returned as an empty string `""` to the client. This prevented database/sql's built in NullString type from
working correctly. From 4.0.0 onwards, null and empty strings will be returned as a `nil`. This allows the usage of the
`sql.NullString` type.

## <a href="https://github.com/fgwe/calcite-avatica-go/releases/tag/v3.2.0">3.2.0</a> / 2018-09-18
{: #v3-2-0}

Apache Calcite Avatica Go 3.2.0 is a minor release of Avatica Go with fixes to the import paths after enabling
support for Go modules.

The 3.1.0 release contained a bug where packages within the library used the `"github.com/fgwe/calcite-avatica-go"`
import path rather than the `"github.com/fgwe/calcite-avatica-go/v3"` import path. This resulted in an issue where
2 versions of the library are being used at the same time, causing some programs to not build.

**The Calcite team recommends consumers of the Avatica Go library to not use the 3.1.0 release and ensure that the
3.2.0 release is being used.**

* [<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-2536">CALCITE-2536</a>]

## <a href="https://github.com/fgwe/calcite-avatica-go/releases/tag/v3.1.0">3.1.0</a> / 2018-09-10
{: #v3-1-0}

Apache Calcite Avatica Go 3.1.0 is a minor release of Avatica Go with support for Go modules.
We recommend using the latest stable version of Go.

Go 1.11 along with Go modules support was released at the end of August 2018. Go modules will become the
official package management solution for Go projects. As the Go team currently supports both Go 1.11 and Go 1.10,
the Gopkg.toml and Gopkg.lock files are still available for those using dep for package management. We plan to
remove support for dep when Go 1.12 is released in early 2019, so we encourage users to upgrade to Go 1.11 and use
Go modules where possible.
